<h1>Food Truck App</h1>
<h3>How the App works</h3>
Displays 2 fragments: Food Trucks and Map.<br>
If you click Map, it marks the locations of all foodtrucks along with your own location as a marker. <br>
Furthermore, it automatically sorts the Food Trucks in the Food Trucks Fragment by the distance from you and the rating for user convenience.<br>
On the Recycler View, click on a FoodTruck to learn more about it including name, rating, location, type of restuarant, phone number (if provided), and hours (if provided) <br><br>
